# Shell Tests
Test your shell against these cases and compare their results.

Some of these cases may not be required by the subject. However, you are free to fix them.

## Requirements and Normal Cases (Happy Path)
### Input
(to be added)

### Quoting
#### Single Quotes
Single quotes ('') removes the special meaning of certain symbols in them, and preserve the literal value of the text. Things like redirection, pipe and dollar-sign variables don't work in them and are used as they are.

- Single-quoted pipe (command1 args '|' command2 args)
	- Bash: The pipe character will be treated as an argument itself and will be fed to the first command. The command will certainly throw an error if it isn't expecting a pipe character as an argument.
	- Minishell: (none)
- Single-quoted redirection (command '>' file, command '> file', command '< file > file2' etc)
	- Bash: As expected, their special meaning is removed and they are treated as arguments.
	- Minishell: (none)
- Single-quoted local shell variables
	- Bash: Ignores the variable and doesn't perform an expansion. It's used as a literal (e.g. echo '$var' literally prints $var to the screen, not the value it holds.)
	- Minishell: (none)
- Single-quoted environment variables
	- Bash: Same as local shell variables.
	- Minishell: (none)
- Single-quoted wildcard (* symbol)
	- Bash: The * symbol is ignored.
	- Minishell: (none)
- Single quote within single quote (e.g. echo 'test ' quote')
	- Bash: The single quote isn't used literally, it just closes the previous single quote, thus rendering the original closing quote 'left open'. When used like this: echo 'test '' quote' as in two single quotes, the result is two different arguments 'test' and 'quote'.
	- Minishell: (none)
- Single-quoted arguments next to each other with no space between them (echo 'arg1''arg2''arg3')
	- Bash: Since there is no space between them when the quotes are removed, they are used as one, joined single argument.
	- Minishell: (none)
- Double quotes within single quotes
	- Bash: The double quotes lose their meaning within single quotes and are used literally. e.g. echo '"test"' prints "test", double quotes included.
	- Minishell: (none)
- Empty single-quotes
	- Bash: They are treated as seperate arguments with no content or length, except for the \0 (null) char.
	- Minishell: (none)
- Unclosed single-quote (echo 'arg)
	- Bash: Adds newline (\n) to the input and prints new prompt (>), waiting for the unclosed quote to be closed. If the first quote is closed but then another quote without closing appears, this step repeats.
	- Minishell: (none)

#### Double Quotes
Dobule quotes ("") removes the special meaning of certain symbols in them, and preserve the literal value of the text, EXCEPT for the dollar ($) sign for shell variables. Other than allowing variable expansion, it works exactly like double quotes.

- Double-quoted pipe (command1 args "|" command2 args)
	- Bash: The pipe character will be treated as an argument itself and will be fed to the first command. The command will certainly throw an error if it isn't expecting a pipe character as an argument.
	- Minishell: (none)
- Double-quoted redirection (command '>' file, command '> file', command '< file > file2' etc)
	- Bash: As expected, their special meaning is removed and they are treated as arguments.
	- Minishell: (none)
- Double-quoted local shell variables
	- Bash: Ignores the variable and doesn't perform an expansion. It's used as a literal (e.g. echo '$var' literally prints $var to the screen, not the value it holds.)
	- Minishell: (none)
- Double-quoted environment variables
	- Bash: Same as local shell variables.
	- Minishell: (none)
- Double-quoted wildcard (* symbol)
	- Bash: * is ignored.
	- Minishell: (none)
- Double quote within double quote (e.g. echo "test " quote")
	- Bash: The double quote isn't used literally, it just closes the previous double quote, thus rendering the original closing quote 'left open'. When used like this: echo "test "" quote" as in two double quotes, the result is two different arguments "test" and "quote".
	- Minishell: (none)
- Double-quoted arguments next to each other with no space between them (echo "arg1""arg2""arg3")
	- Bash: Since there is no space between them when the quotes are removed, they are used as one, joined single argument.
	- Minishell: (none)
- Single quotes within double quotes
	- Bash: The single quotes lose their meaning within double quotes and are used literally. e.g. echo "'test'" prints 'test', single quotes included.
	- Minishell: (none)
- Empty double-quotes
	- Bash: They are treated as seperate arguments with no content or length, except for the \0 (null) char.
	- Minishell: (none)
- Unclosed Double-quote (echo "arg)
	- Bash: Adds newline (\n) to the input and prints new prompt (>), waiting for the unclosed quote to be closed. If the first quote is closed but then another quote without closing appears, this step repeats.
	- Minishell: (none)

### Variables
#### Environment Variables
- \$PATH: A colon-separated list of directories in which the shell looks for commands.

#### Special Variables
- $_ (underscore): It does two things: First, it's the name (or path if fully given) of the used command, set as an environment variable and passed to the process. Second, it's the name of the last expanded argument in a list, changed after executing the process so both of them are separated.
- $?: Expand to the exit status of the most recently executed foreground pipeline.

### Expansion
(to be added)

### Redirection
#### '<' Operator (Infile)
The '<' doesn't just redirect the target file to stdin, it does more. The full syntax is 'num<word', and the input is redirected to the file descriptor 'num'. The Bash syntax allows multiple infile redirections, even if they all share the same num. The last coming redirection to the same number overrides previous redirections.

#### '<<' Operator (Heredoc)
Same with the Infile operator, but its syntax is 'num<<EOF'. It reads input from stdin until it encounters the word choosen as EOF, and redirects it to the number.

#### '>' Operator (Outfile)
The '>' doesn't just redirect stdout to the target file, it does more. The full syntax is 'num>word', and the output is redirected to the file descriptor 'num'. The Bash syntax allows multiple outfile redirections, even if they all share the same num. The last coming redirection to the same number overrides previous redirections.

#### '>>' Operator (Append)
Same with the Outfile operator, but it doesn't open the files in truncate mode. Instead, it appends the changes to the end of the file.

### Pipelines
(to be added)

### Builtins
You have to implement a total of 7 shell builtins (man builtins).

NOTE: No option doesn't mean no arguments, they are seperate things! For example, you should still be able to provide an exit code to the exit command.

#### echo
You have to implement the 'echo' builtin with the '-n' option.

#### cd
You have to implement the 'cd' builtin with only a relative or an absolute path.

Optional: Providing no argument to cd goes to the $HOME path. Providing the '-' argument goes to the directory you were previously in.

#### pwd
You have to implement the 'pwd' builtin with no options.

#### export
You have to implement the 'export' builtin with no options.

#### unset
You have to implement the 'unset' builtin with no options.

#### env
You have to implement the 'env' builtin with no options or arguments.

#### exit
You have to implement the 'exit' builtin with no options.

### History
Your shell should have a working history. Bash stores the history in the file HISTFILE, and stores up to HISTFILESIZE numbers of history.

- HISTSIZE: The number of commands in history. If set to 0, history utilities will be disabled. If set to a negative number, history is infinite. Default value is 500.
- HISTFILE: The path of the history file is stored in this variable. Bash dumps the current history to this file upon exit, capped by the maximum lines of history (HISTFILESIZE).

### Line Editing
Using GNU Readline grants you command line editing tools and controls.

- Tab: Autocomplete
	- Expected: Autocompletes words, either by expanding them to commands or files in the current directory.
	- Current: Autocompletes filenames as expected, but doesn't autocomplete commands.
- ↑ (Up Arrow): History up
	- Expected: Goes up in the history and replaces the current line with that line.
	- Current: Doesn't work yet (no history).
- ↓ (Bottom Arrow): History down
	- Expected: Goes down in the history and replaces the current line with that line.
	- Current: Doesn't work yet (no history).
- Ctrl + R: Search in history
	- Expected: Replaces the current prompt with an interactive 'search mode' field. It searches the commands in history as you type.
	- Current: Ctrl + R works and activates the search field, but it can't find anything in history because there is no history yet.
- Ctrl + C: Cancels the current command and presents a new prompt
	- Current: Cancels the current prompt but doesn't cancel the running process
- Ctrl + D: Closes the current Bash instance, possibly also closing the terminal-emulator
	- Current: Doesn't work

#### Optional Line Editing Tools
GNU Readline grants you extra line editing capabilities. These come by default when you use Readline, so you don't have to implement them on your own. However, it's a good idea to test them and check if they work correctly and as expected.

- Ctrl + F:  Move the cursor one character to the right
	- Status: Works
- Ctrl + B: Move the cursor one character to the left
	- Status: Works
- Alt + F: Move the cursor one word to the right
	- Status: Works
- Alt + B: Move the cursor one word to the left
	- Status works
- Ctrl + A: Move the cursor to the beginning of the current commandline
	- Status: Works
- Ctrl + E: Move the cursor to the end of the current commandline
	- Status: Works
- Ctrl + S: Put the terminal to sleep
	- Status: Works
- Ctrl + Q: Wake the terminal; buffered keypresses are then processed
	- Status: Works
- Ctrl + W: Remove one word to the left of the cursor
	- Status: Works
- Ctrl + Z: Stop a foregrounded process
	- Status: Doesn't work. Stops the minishell instance instead.

### Exit Status
Holds either:
- The exit status of the last executed command in a command chain in a variable ($?), or,
- Retrieved signals. If it's a signal, the exit status is '128 + signal number'.

## Edge Cases

### Input
- Very long argument
	- Bash: Returns "bash: /usr/lib/command-not-found: Argument list too long" error. (Bash uses /usr/lib/command-not-found when the given command is not found.)
	- Minishell: (none)
- Very long argument list
	- Bash: Works slow but still works.
	- Minishell: (none)

### Quoting
#### Single Quotes
(to be added)

#### Double Quotes
(to be added)

### Variables
#### Environment Variables
##### $PATH
- Empty $PATH
	- Bash: If PATH is empty, or there is an empty (null) path provided amongs the other paths, the current directory is included in the path.
	- Minishell: (none)

##### $SHLVL
SHLVL is always set to the current level of the nested shells. It starts from 1. If you type bash and enter, it will be 2. Then 3, then 4, and so on.

### Expansion
#### Variable Expansion
- Non-quoted expansions on variables with spaces inside them (var="word word2", echo $var)
	- Bash: When expanded, these words inside the variable turn into seperate arguments due to the space between them.
- Quoted expansions on variables with spaces inside them (var="word word2", echo "$var")
	- Bash: The double quotes protect the seperate words in the variable, preventing them to become seperate arguments.
-
#### Wildcard Expansion
- Wildcard in single quotes (echo '*')
	- Bash: The * symbol lose its meaning and is printed as a string literal.
- Wildcard in double quotes (echo "*")
	- Bash: The * symbol lose its meaning and is printed as a string literal.
- Wildcard inside paramater (var="*")
	- Bash: Wildcard is expaned when the variable isn't enclosed with quotes (e.g. echo $var). If enclosed (e.g. echo "$var"), the command becomes echo "*" upon variable expansion, and wildcard expansion doesn't happen due to the quotes.


### Built-ins
#### echo
